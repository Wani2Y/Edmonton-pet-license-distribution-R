## Source Data
This project uses licenced pet data between 2019 and 2020, to explore which neighbourhood prefer cats over dogs. Numbers of cat and dog licences are summed up and compared by neighbourhoud, and the results are mapped on a map of Edmonton using a .shp file. Lastly, the exported map is decorated by memes in Adobe Photoshop such that it would be better received by the general public.

Creator of the source data also produced a dashboard with more detailed information on dog breeds (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/city.of.edmonton/viz/EdmontonPetLicenses/EdmontonPetLicenses).
